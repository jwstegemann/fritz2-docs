# Project Setup

To use fritz2, you have to set up a Kotlin multiplatform-project. To do so you can either

* clone our template-project from [github](https://github.com/jwstegemann/fritz2-template)
* clone the [fritz2-examples](https://github.com/jamowei/fritz2-examples) and copy from one of the sub-projects
* have a look a the [official documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/building-mpp-with-gradle.html#setting-up-a-multiplatform-project) and include the following plugin:

```gradle
plugins {
    id("dev.fritz2.fritz2-gradle") version "0.6"
}

repositories {
    jcenter()
}

kotlin {
    jvm()
    js().browser()

    sourceSets {
        val commonMain by getting {
            dependencies {
                implementation(kotlin("stdlib"))
            }
        }
        val jvmMain by getting {
            dependencies {
            }
        }
        val jsMain by getting {
            dependencies {
            }
        }
    }
}
```

We recommend organizing your source code like this:

* \<project-root\>
  * src
    * commonMain
      * kotlin
        * model.kt (to use the model in client and server)
    * jsMain
      * kotlin
        * \<your base package\>
          * app.kt (or choose any other name)
      * resources
        * index.html

The `index.html`is just a normal web-page. Be sure to include the resulting script-file from your Kotlin/JS-build. Also mark an element of your choice with an id to later mount your fritz2-components to:

```html
<html>
  <body id="target">
    Loading...
    <script src="yourProject.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

`app.kt` is the starting point of your fritz2 app, so make sure it has a `main`-function. Inside `main`, you might want to create some content by creating a `render`-context, adding [some `Tag`s](https://api.fritz2.dev/core/dev.fritz2.dom.html/-html-elements) and mount it to the DOM of your `index.html`:

```kotlin
package <your package>

import dev.fritz2.dom.html.render
import dev.fritz2.dom.mount

fun main() {
    render {
        div("some-fix-css-class") {
            p(id = "someId") {
                text("Hello World!")
            }
        }
    }.mount("target")
}
```

Run the project by calling `./gradlew jsRun` in your project's main directory. Add `--continuous` to enable automatic building and reloading in the browser after changing your code.

And voil√†, you are done! Maybe you would like to create some more versatile [HTML](Attributes%20and%20CSS.html) now?  

## Pre-release builds
If you want get the newest snapshot-builds of fritz2 before we release them add the following lines to your 'build.gradle.kts':
```gradle
...
repositories {
    jcenter()
    maven("https://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/jfrog-dependencies") // new repository here
}

kotlin {
    jvm()
    js().browser()

    sourceSets {
        val commonMain by getting {
            dependencies {
                implementation(kotlin("stdlib"))
                implementation("dev.fritz2:core:0.7-SNAPSHOT") // add the newer snapshot version here
            }
        }
        ...
    }
}
```
