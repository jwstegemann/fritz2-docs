# Routing

Writing a Single Page Application (SPA), you might need a way to render a certain view depending on url-parameters. This is called routing. 
fritz2 uses the hash-part of the url which starts with a `#`: `https://my.doma.in/path#hash`. url-parameters (`?`) are usually handled by the server, 
while url-hashes (`#`) are handled by the browser.

fritz2 offers a general mechanism for using client-site routing in your SPA. 
It includes a class called `Router` which registers itself to listen for the specific dom-events of the hash changing. 
Additionally, a `Router` needs a `Route` which is an interface you have to implement to use it:
```kotlin
interface Route<T> {
    val default: T
    fun deserialize(hash: String): T
    fun serialize(route: T): String
}
```
A `Route` always has a default route to start with.
It also needs a way to serialize and deserialize the url-hash string to a kotlin (data-)class and vice versa.

To make this mechanism easier to use, we already implemented two ways of handling routing in fritz2: 
* `StringRoute` uses the url-hash how it is.
* `MapRoute` serialize and deserialize the url-hash to `Map<String,String>` where `&` is the separator between the entries.

You can easily create a new instance of `Router` by using the global `routerOf()` function. 
There are currently three of them for each type of your `Route`.
* `routerOf(default: String): Router<String>` which uses `StringRoute`
* `routerOf(default: Map<String, String>): MapRouter` which uses `MapRoute`
* `<T> routerOf(default: Route<T>): Router<T>` which uses your custom implementation of the `Route` interface

Routing is straightforward:
Using simple `String`s by `StringRoute`:
```kotlin
val router = routerOf("welcome")

render {
    section {
        router.data.render { site ->
            when(site) {
                "welcome" -> div { +"Welcome" }
                "pageA" -> div { +"Page A" }
                "pageB" -> div { +"Page B" }
                else -> div { +"not found" }
            }
        }
    }
}

val currentRoute = router.current
```

Using a `Map`:
```kotlin
val router = routerOf(mapOf("page" to "welcome"))

render {
    section {
        router.select(key = "page", orElse = "").render { value ->
            when(value) {
                "welcome" -> div { +"Welcome" }
                "pageA" -> div { +"Page A" }
                "pageB" -> div { +"Page B" }
                else -> div { +"not found" }
            }
        }
    }
}

val currentRoute = router.current
```
A router using a `MapRoute` offers two extra `select` methods:
* `fun select(key: String): Flow<Pair<String?, Map<String, String>>>` extracts the values as `Pair` for the given `key` 
and the rest of the route
* `fun select(key: String, orElse: String): Flow<String>` extracts the value for a given `key` when available otherwise 
it returns `orElse`

If you want to use your own special `Route` instead, try this:
```kotlin
class SetRoute(override val default: Set<String>) : Route<Set<String>> {
    private val separator = "&"
    override fun deserialize(hash: String): Set<String> = hash.split(separator).toSet()
    override fun serialize(route: Set<String>): String = route.joinToString(separator)
}

val router = routerOf(SetRoute(setOf("welcome")))

render {
    section {
        router.data.render { route ->
            when {
                route.contains("welcome") -> div { +"Welcome" }
                route.contains("pageA") -> div { +"Page A" }
                route.contains("pageB") -> div { +"Page B" }
                else -> div { +"not found" }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In more complex scenarios, it's common to create your own implementation of `Router` by using either the
`StringRouter` or `MapRouter` as parent class:
```kotlin
object MyRouter : MapRouter(mapOf("page" to "overview")) {

    val overview = handle {
        it + ("page" to "overview")
    }

    val details = handle<String> { route, id ->
        route + mapOf("page" to "details", "detailsId" to id)
    }
}
```
This lets you create custom handlers inside your router to improve internal state managing, analogous to our `Store`s.


If you want to change your current route (e.g. when an event fires), 
you can do so by calling the predefined handler `navTo`: 
```kotlin
val router = routerOf("welcome")

render {
    button {
        +"Navigate to Page A"
        clicks.map { "pageA" } handledBy router.navTo
    }
}
// or call handler directly
router.navTo("pageA")
```
Or call your own handlers in case you created any:
```kotlin
object MyRouter : MapRouter(mapOf("page" to "overview")) {
    val overview = handle { it + ("page" to "overview") }
    val details = handle<String> { route, id -> route + mapOf("page" to "details", "detailsId" to id) }
}

render {
    button {
        +"Show overview"
        clicks handledBy MyRouter.overview
    }
    button {
        +"Show details"
        clicks.map { "12" } handledBy MyRouter.details
    }
}
// or call handler directly
MyRouter.details("12")
```
