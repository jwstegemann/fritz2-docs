# Getting Started

We recommend organizing your source code like this:

* \<project-root\>
  * src
    * commonMain
      * kotlin
        * \<your base package\>
          * model.kt (to use the model in client and server)
    * jsMain
      * kotlin
        * \<your base package\>
          * app.kt (or choose any other name)
      * resources
        * index.html

The `index.html`is just a normal web-page. Be sure to include the resulting script-file from your Kotlin/JS-build .
You can mark an element of your choice with an id to later mount your fritz2-components to it:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Your title</title>
  </head>
  <body id="target">
    Loading...
    <script src="yourProject.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

`app.kt` is the starting point of your fritz2 app, so make sure it has a `main`-function. 
Inside `main`, you might want to create some content by creating a `render`-context, 
adding [some `Tag`s](https://api.fritz2.dev/core/core/dev.fritz2.dom.html/-render-context/index.html) and 
mount it to the DOM of your `index.html`:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    render {
        h1 { +"My App" }
        div("some-fix-css-class") {
            p(id = "someId") {
                +"Hello World!"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

By calling render the way above your content will be mounted to the `body` of your document. Set the `targetElement` parameter to mount your content to any other element. Using the `override`parameter you can define it the existing children of the element you are mounting to will be removed (which is the default behaviour) or will be preserved (and your content will be appended).

Run the project by calling `./gradlew jsRun` in your project's main directory. Add `--continuous` to enable automatic
building and reloading in the browser after changing your code.

And voil√†, you are done! Maybe you would like to create some more versatile [HTML](Attributes%20and%20CSS.html) now?
