# Project Setup

To use fritz2, you have to set up a Kotlin/JS-project. To do so you can either

* clone our template-project from [github](https://github.com/jwstegemann/fritz2-template)
* clone the whole fritz2-repo and use the gettingstarted sub-project under examples
* have a look a the [official documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/javascript/getting-started-gradle/getting-started-with-gradle.html) and include the following dependency:

```gradle
repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    implementation("io.fritz2:fritz2-core-js:0.4")
}
```

We recommend organizing your source code like this:

* \<project-root\>
  * src
    * main
      * kotlin
        * \<your base package\>
          * app.kt (or choose any other name)
      * resources
        * index.html

The `index.html`is just a normal web-page. Be sure to include the resulting script-file from your Kotlin/JS-build. Also mark an element of your choice with an id to later mount your fritz2-components to:

```html
<html>
  <body id="target">
    Loading...
    <script src="yourProject.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

`app.kt` is the starting point of your fritz2 app, so make sure it has a `main`-function. Inside `main`, you might want to create some content by creating a `render`-context, adding [some `Tag`s](https://api.fritz2.dev/fritz2/io.fritz2.dom.html/-html-elements) and mount it to the DOM of your `index.html`:

```kotlin
package <your package>

import io.fritz2.dom.html.html
import io.fritz2.dom.mount

fun main() {
    render {
        div("some-fix-css-class") {
            p(id = "someId") {
                text("Hello World!")
            }
        }
    }.mount("target")
}
```

Run the project by calling `./gradlew run` in your project's main directory. Add `--continuous` to enable automatic building and reloading in the browser when you change your code.

And voil√†, you are done! Maybe you would like to create some more versatile [HTML](Attributes%20and%20CSS.html) now?
