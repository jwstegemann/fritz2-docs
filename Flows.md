# Flows

fritz2 heavily depends on flows, introduced by [kotlinx.coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines).

A `Flow` is a time discrete stream of values. 

Like a collection, you can use `Flow`s to represent multiple values, but unlike other collections like `List`s, for example, the values are retrieved one by one. fritz2 relies on `Flow`s to represent values that change over time (your data-model for example).

A `Flow` is built from a source which creates the values. This source could be your model or the events raised by an element, for example. On the other end of the `Flow`, a simple function called for each element collects the values one by one. Between those two ends, various actions can be taken on the data (formatting strings, creating HTML-Tags out of your model data, filtering the values, etc).

The great thing about `Flow`s is that they are _cold_, which means that nothing is calculated before the result is needed. This makes them perfect for fritz2's use case.

In Kotlin, there is another communication model called `Channel` which is the _hot_ counterpart of the `Flow`. fritz2 only uses `Channel`s internally to feed the flows, so you should not encounter them while using fritz2. 

To get more information about `Flow`s, `Channel`s, and their API, have a look at the [official documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html).

Now you have seen how fritz2 handles events and the state of your app. Next, have a closer look at the [Store](Store.html)...
