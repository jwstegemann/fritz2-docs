# Welcome

Since we want you to build the best, most efficient, successful, and whatever-else-you-want web-apps with fritz2, 
we happily provide you with all the documentation you need in order to use it.

We do our best to present the different topics and concepts in a helpful order. If you want to stick with it, 
we suggest to start reading with [Project Setup](ProjectSetup.html), otherwise just pick your topic of interest from the menu.

We always try our best with fritz2 and would love your feedback! Please feel free to open an 
[issue](https://github.com/jwstegemann/fritz2/issues/new/choose) whenever 
you find something missing, misleading or even plain wrong in our documentation. We also encourage everybody to 
share their own examples and showcases with us, as this is often the best way to learn something new.
