# Welcome

Since we want you to use fritz2 to build the best and most efficient, and successful (and whatever you want) web-apps, we try to provide you with all the documentation you need to do so.

We did our best to bring the different topics and concepts in a meaningful order. Please start reading with [Project Setup](Project.html) if you want to follow it. Otherwise just pick from the menu, what is of interest for you.

To be honest, as with many developers, writing documentation is not what we like most about programming. Though we tried our best and we invite you to open an issue, whenever you find anything that is missing, misunderstanding or even wrong in our documentation. Also we invite everybody to provide us with good examples or showcases, since we think that this often is the best way to learn something new.
